# Check-Votes

There are some communities whose working model consists of select posts from community members and spread them to all members. In this order, this set of posts receives more attention and votes. However, it is difficult for the community to measure the impact and effectiveness of this work. **Are the community members giving support to these posts? who gives more votes?** To solve these questions the moderators make manual analysis and they have to check the posts one by one.

**Check Votes is a response to these needs**. The user only inserts the links of the posts and the App will show the curators classified by the number of votes.
